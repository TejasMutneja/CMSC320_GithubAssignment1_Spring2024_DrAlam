Why are you interested in taking CMSC320?
Taking CMSC320, "Intro to Data Science," is important for me because it's a 
required course for my machine learning major. I want to learn about data science 
because it helps me understand how to work with big sets of data, which is really
important in machine learning. By studying topics like data preprocessing and 
analysis in CMSC320, I can get better at handling large datasets. This course
will also prepare me for more advanced classes and make me more attractive 
employers in the future. So, I'm excited to learn and get better at data 
science through CMSC320.
